Whether the throned monarch weareth the crown
Which I know not to his belongeth
Doth he hence the sceptre sway?
Seasoneth he justice?
Daresay I he doth not
Will he then use his sceptre as a wand?
Where doth sit my awe?
Trieth me conjure
Perchance a spell, a reptile, a sullied hound?
Is the gentle rain a quality of his?
I bethink this fro my thoughts, hitherto about this
I beheld to these words no tongue
Are the monarch's men his thralls or his servants?
